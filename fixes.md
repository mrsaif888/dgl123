Features And Fixes
Data Redundancy:
To address data redundancy in your project, consider normalizing the database by organizing data into well-defined tables and minimizing redundant information. Implement proper relationships between tables, utilize foreign keys, and avoid storing the same data in multiple locations. Regularly review and update the database schema to ensure efficiency and data consistency.
Fix:
Using the laracast videos from 21-25 there is a code provided there to help me with this issue of storing existing users in the data base again and again.

Displaying the Name Rather than email:
After the sign in process the website layout show the full email of the users which is not good for the presentation so with the help of laracast video I will fetch the userâ€™s first name from the data base and will display it in the place of email.
