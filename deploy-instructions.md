"I initiated a new branch named 'deploym3' in my project. Subsequently, I crafted comprehensive deployment instructions and documented them in the README file. To ensure data consistency, I exported my SQL file from PHPMyAdmin and seamlessly integrated it into the designated database via cPanel.

Following that, I compressed my project files into a zip archive and uploaded them to the cPanel domain. Additionally, I captured screenshots of the deployed website, which are now included in this repository. All relevant links, including those for the deployed instructions and website screenshots, have been thoughtfully added to the README file for easy reference."
